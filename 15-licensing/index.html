<p>When a repository with source code, a manuscript
or other creative works becomes public, it should include a
file <code class="highlighter-rouge">LICENSE</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">LICENSE.txt</code> in the base directory of the
repository that clearly states under which license the content is
being made available. This is because
as creative works, source code is automatically eligible for
intellectual property (and thus copyright) protection. Code that appears to be, or is expressly
advertised as freely available has <em>not</em> waived such
protection. Hence, those who (re)use code that lacks a license
statement do so on their own peril, because the author(s)
of the software code can always unilaterally make such reuse illegal.</p>

<p>A license solves this problem by granting rights to others (the
licensees) that they would otherwise not have. What rights are being
granted under which conditions differs, often only slightly, from one
license to another. In contrast to proprietary licenses, the
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">open licences</a> certified by
the <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> all grant at
least the following rights, referred to as the
<a href="http://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The source code is available, and may be used and redistributed
without restrictions, including as part of aggregate distributions.</li>
  <li>Modifications or other derived works are allowed, and can be
redistributed as well.</li>
  <li>The question of who receives these rights is not subject to
discrimination, including not by fields of endeavor such as
commercial versus academic.</li>
</ol>

<p>How best to choose an appropriate license can seem daunting, given how
many possibilities there are. In practice, a few licenses are by far
the most popular, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0">GNU General Public License</a>
(GPL),</li>
  <li><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">BSD license</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The GPL is different from most other open source licenses in that it
is
<a href="reference.html#infective">infective</a>:
anyone who distributes a modified version of the code, or anything
that includes GPL’ed code, must make <em>their</em> code freely available as
well.</p>

<p>“<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002598">A Quick Guide to Software Licensing for the
Scientist-Programmer</a>”
by Morin, Urban, and Sliz provides an excellent overview of licensing
and licensing options from the perspective of scientists who also
write code:</p>

<p>At the end of the day what matters is that there is a clear statement
as to what the license is, and that the license is one already vetted
and approved by <a href="http://opensource.org">OSI</a>. Also, the license is
best chosen from the get-go, even if for a repository that is not
public. Pushing off the decision only makes it more complicated later,
because each time a new collaborator starts contributing, they, too,
hold copyright and will thus need to be asked for approval once a
license is chosen.</p>

<p>If the content of a repository contains research products other than
software, such as data, and/or creative writing (manuals, technical
reports, manuscripts), most licenses designed for software are <em>not</em>
suitable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data:</strong> In most jurisdictions most types of data (with possibly
the exception of photos, medical images, etc) are considered facts
of nature, and are hence not eligible for copyright
protection. Therefore, using a license, which by definition asserts
copyright, to signal social or scholarly expectations for
attribution serves only to create a legally murky situation. It is
much better to clarify the legal side with a public domain waiver
such as
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a>,
and the social expectations side with express requests for how to
use and cite the data. The <a href="http://datadryad.org">Dryad</a> data
repository in fact requires this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Creative works:</strong> Manuals, reports, manuscripts and other
creative works are eligible for intellectual property protection and
are hence automatically protected by copyright, just as software source
code. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> has prepared a
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">set of licenses</a> using
combinations of four basic restrictions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Attribution: derived works must give the original author credit
for their work.</li>
      <li>No Derivatives: people may copy the work, but must pass it along
unchanged.</li>
      <li>Share Alike: derivative works must license their work under the
same terms as the original.</li>
      <li>Noncommercial: free use is allowed, but commercial use is not.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Only the Attribution
(<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a>) and
Share-Alike
(<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>)
licenses are considered “<a href="http://opendefinition.org/">Open</a>”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://software-carpentry.org/license.html">Software Carpentry</a>
uses CC-BY for its lessons and the MIT License for its code
in order to encourage the widest possible re-use.
Again,
the most important thing is for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">LICENSE</code> file in the root directory of your project
to state clearly what your license is.
You may also want to include a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">CITATION</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">CITATION.txt</code>
that describes how to reference your project;
the one for Software Carpentry states:</p>

<div class="source highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>To reference Software Carpentry in publications, please cite both of the following:

Greg Wilson: "Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned". arXiv:1307.5448, July 2013.

  title       = {Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned},

  <p>Find out whether you are allowed to apply an open license to your software.
Can you do this unilaterally,
or do you need permission from someone in your institution?
If so, who?</p>

<blockquote class="keypoints">
  <h2>Key Points</h2>
  <ul>
    
    <li><p>People who incorporate GPL’d software into their own software must make their software also open under the GPL license; most other open licenses do not require this.</p>
</li>
    
    <li><p>The Creative Commons family of licenses allow people to mix and match requirements and restrictions on attribution, creation of derivative works, further sharing, and commercialization.</p>
</li>
    
    <li><p>People who are not lawyers should not try to write licenses from scratch.</p>
